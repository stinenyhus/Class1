## Pre-class 1 Exercises

The warm-up for class will use the mtcars dataset which is always present in R.
The following code shows you how load the dataset

```{r load the data}
pacman::p_load(pacman, tidyverse) #laod packages
? mtcars # what are the variables
cars <- mtcars %>% rownames_to_column(var = "type") # tranform to tibble
```


This a brief re-introduction to the tidyverse package in R

This is something we went through during 1st semester so you should be able to do it, however if the summer have been to harsh I recommend consulting R for data science chapter 5: https://r4ds.had.co.nz
```{r}
# Using mutate - convert miles per gallon to liters

cars <- mutate(cars, mpl = mpg/3.78541178)

# Using filter - find all the cars which have more that 4 gears and are automatic

cars_filtered1 <- filter(cars, gear>4 & am == 0)

#No cars have more than 4 automatic gears 

cars_filtered2 <- filter(cars, gear>=4 & am == 0)

# But 4 cars have 4 automatic gears 

# Using select - create a column dataframe with only miles pr. gallon, weight and number og gears

cars_selected <- select(cars, mpg, wt, gear)

# Using arrange - What cars are most fuel efficient? (lowest miles pr. liter/gallon)

cars_arranged <- arrange(cars, mpg) #in ascending order which is the default 
cars_arranged <- arrange(cars,desc(mpg)) #In descending order, which is most fuel efficient 

# Using Group_by and summarise - Find out how many cars have 3 gears, how many have 4 and how many have 5 (tip use n(), with summarise to count number of occurences)

by_gears <- cars %>% group_by(gear) %>% summarise(n()) 
#gives a tibble telling how many cars have 3, 4 and 5 gears respectively

# If you haven't yet, solve the above task using pipe, they look like this '%>%' and can be read as 'then' e.g. the following lines:
mtcars %>% 
  mutate(number = 200) %>% 
  summarise(sum_num = sum(number)) %>% 
  mutate(n_row = sum_num / 200)
# can be read as 'take mtcars, 
  # THEN add a column called numbers which is equal to 200
  # THEN the summarise the using the sum of numbers 
  # THEN divide the sum of the number by 200 to get the number of rows

#create some sort of plot plotting the data

p_load(ggplot2)
cars$gear <- as.factor(cars$gear)

ggplot(cars, aes(gear, mpl, fill = gear))+
  geom_bar(stat="summary")+
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("skyblue", "royalblue", "navy"))+
  geom_errorbar(stat= "summary", fun.data = mean_se, width = 0.3)+
  theme(legend.position = "none")

```
